File Descriptions
-----------------

#1	Primary configuration file for "seqapp" application.



#5: NGINX
	#5	A copy of the nginx config file used for establishing HTTP 
		access to the app-hosting server.

#6-8: Sessions Results Viewer
	Scripts & files composing the user-accessible HTTP-based web
	browsing of all "seqapp"-generated analysis results files by date and 
	"seqapp" RUN ID (these are copies; the real files are ran under 
	/dash-webapp-template/seqapp/prod/sessions/, where the original raw per-session
	results file are written to).

	#6	A simple static HTML file which displays basic info about the 
		http://apps01:9000/ "seqapp" Run Sessions directory viewing ser-
		vice.

	#7	A custom PHP script for generating a dynamic HTML file

	#8	A shell script which is executed as a "PREEXEC" statement
		via the custom dash-webapp-templateseq systemd service, which updates
		the /dash-webapp-template/seqapp/prod/sessions/.sessions.log file by
		appending any/all latest new "seqapp" user sessions using
		'"seqapp" RUN ID'.

#9-10: Systemd config files

	#9	A short config file for gracefully auto-restarting the app
		if app URL is accessed and the service isn't already running
		(potentially deprecated; this socket is referenced in the
		nginx.conf).

	#10	The custom systemd configuration file dash-webapp-template-seqapp.service
		which creates an eponymous linux systemd daemon service
		to ensure graceful restart of the "seqapp" app upont machine
		reboot, and which contains 'PREEXEC' statements always
		first running the scTCR data sync update and sessions
		viewer update mini-pipeline programs.
